# GOD Mode Session Record
**Project**: STARTUP SIM
**Date**: Fri Aug 15 20:18:19 EDT 2025
**Mode**: CONTINUE
**Requirements**: ⏺ I've created a basic CLAUDE.md file for your empty project directory. Since there's no existing codebase to analyze, the file contains a minimal template that
  should be updated as your project develops. When you add code, build systems, or dependencies, remember to update this file with the relevant commands and
  architecture information.
